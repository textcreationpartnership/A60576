            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="6">6. They give preſent eaſe, relief, and comfort, working gently by Urine and ſtool. they ſtrengthen the body, and agree with all conſtitutions; thereby curing moſt cureable diſeaſes, taking away all pains lameneſs and inward ſtoppages: They are an excellent head-purge for all diſeaſes in the head, as head-ach megrims gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and Rheumy Eyes, beyond any medicin ever yet known: and for all ſuch as have ſpoyled their bodies by heats and colds, or hard-drinking, in their young days; more can ſcarſely be done by any medicine.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

            <p n="8">8. They purge by ſtool flegm, choler, and melancholy; they diſpoſe old Ulcers, Fiſtula's, running ſores, ſore-Breaſts, ſore-eyes, ſcald heads, Kings-evil ſores, tetters, ringworms, ſalt humours, ſcabs, or any other breakings out to a ſpeedy healing, by purging away the evil humors which feeds them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They are an excellent help for all riſings, Vapors, clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, ſtuffings, gnawing or illneſſe at the ſtomach; for ſuch as grow too fat, purſie, ſweat or ſpit much, have coſtive or hot bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and for all ſuch as have loſt their complexions by the <hi>Scurvy, Jaundice,</hi> or green-ſickneſs; ſuch as are overtaken with lingring diſeaſes, growing worſe and worſe every year than other, with melancholy ſtoppages in the head and breſt, ſhortneſs of breath, and ill digeſtion, till ſuch time as they fall into dropſies, the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Hectick feavers or deep Conſumptions, lingring and waſting away with dry coughs, wheeſings, faint ſweats and the like; theſe my <hi>Family-Pills</hi> carry off all thoſe diſeaſes the right way, by taking them once twice thrice or four times a month.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They are the only Pills now uſed, in the Cure of all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid diſeaſes, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in many forrein coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Kingdoms, being cryed up, and prized above all other medicins whatſoever, inſomuch that in ſome hundreds of families, on moſt occaſions, they are their only Phyſick; (and from hence they came to be called <hi>Family-Pills</hi>) bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="11">11. With theſe my <hi>Family Pills,</hi> I have cur'd two hundred and twenty Perſons of the Scurvy; one hundred and twelve of the Dropſie; one hundred Eighty Six of the Green-ſickneſſe; one hundred twenty five of the Evil; one hundred and fourteen of the Headach; ninety ſeven of Worms; Eighty four of the Jaundice; ſeventy three of ſtinking breaths; beſides vaſt numbers of people, (which come dayly to me) of moſt other diſtempers, with the drops I cured one hundred and thirty of Conſumptions; one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fourty two of pain and weakneſſe of the back: and I have ſold them and cauſed them to be given away to above two thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have had agues, with a promiſe to all ſuch as bought them, that if they cured them not, they ſhould have their money again;
<pb facs="tcp:35777:3"/>and yet never heard to this day, that ever they miſt the cure of one man, woman, or child; although I have uſed them upwards of 20 years. By uſing theſe pills and drops inwardly, and the balſam outwardly, I have cured above one hundred perſons of the Gout, ſome of which had gon on Crutches above a dozen years.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They cure the <hi>Gonorrhaa</hi> and ſharpneſſe of Urine, with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Diſeaſes Veneral,</hi> although of many years ſtanding; all ulcers and ſtoppages in the reines, bladder and womb; they kill all ſorts of worms, cauſe a good appetite and a ſtrong digeſtion; taking away all ſwellings from the belly, Thighs, and Legs, being the beſt remedy known in the world for the Dropſy and Gout; taking away all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pains from the very bones, when no other means whatſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

Many bed rid, and given over to all appearance, have unexpectedly met with a cure almoſt to a miracle; in ſo much that many learned Phiſitians, could not but admire at their Vertues.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſucceſſe and ſafety of theſe Pills, have brought them into credit and Eſtimation, almoſt through the whole world; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they that take theſe, need not go under long, dangerous and chargable courſes of Phyſick, ſuffer by bad medicines, and be driven time after time from one Phyſitian to another.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Where the diſeaſe has been of long continuance, a perfect Cure cannot be expected in 5 or 6 times taking, in thoſe caſes take them in the largeſt doſe; and at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
